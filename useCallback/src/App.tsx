   * 🎯 MAIN FEATURE: useCallback Implementation
   *
   * This function is memoized using useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   * of the Search component (which is wrapped with React.memo).
   *
   * 🔍 What happens WITHOUT useCallback:
   * 1. Every time App re-renders (e.g., when shuffle button is clicked)
   * 2. handleSearch function gets recreated with new reference
   * 3. Search component receives new props (different function reference)
   * 4. React.memo comparison fails → Search re-renders unnecessarily
   * 5. Performance degradation in larger apps
   *
   * ✅ What happens WITH useCallback:
   * 1. Function reference stays the same between renders (when deps don't change)
   * 2. Search component props remain stable
   * 3. React.memo prevents unnecessary re-renders
   * 4. Better performance and optimization

🎯 =================================================================
               USECALLBACK IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
=================================================================

📋 WHAT I'VE IMPLEMENTED:

1. ⚡ useCallback Hook Usage
   ├── Memoized handleSearch function to prevent recreation
   ├── Empty dependency array [] = function never changes
   └── Prevents unnecessary Search component re-renders

2. 🎨 React.memo Integration (Search.tsx)
   ├── Search component wrapped with React.memo
   ├── Only re-renders when props actually change
   └── Works perfectly with useCallback for optimization

3. 🎲 Performance Testing Setup
   ├── Shuffle button to trigger parent re-renders
   ├── Console logs to track component render cycles
   └── Visual feedback to understand optimization impact

4. 🎨 Enhanced UI/UX
   ├── Modern gradient background with glassmorphism
   ├── Smooth hover animations and transitions
   ├── Responsive design for mobile devices
   └── Performance indicator for educational purposes

=================================================================
🔍 WHY THIS IMPLEMENTATION WORKS:

❌ WITHOUT useCallback:
   1. App re-renders → new handleSearch created
   2. Search gets new prop → React.memo comparison fails
   3. Search unnecessarily re-renders → console log appears
   4. Performance degradation in complex apps

✅ WITH useCallback:
   1. App re-renders → same handleSearch reference
   2. Search props unchanged → React.memo prevents re-render
   3. Search only renders when actually needed
   4. Optimized performance and stable references

=================================================================
🧪 HOW TO TEST THE OPTIMIZATION:

1. Open Browser DevTools Console
2. Click "Shuffle Users" button multiple times
3. Notice: "Search component rendered" only appears on initial load
4. Try typing in search box - component renders only when needed
5. Remove useCallback and see the difference!

=================================================================
💡 KEY LEARNINGS FROM THIS IMPLEMENTATION:

✅ useCallback is perfect for:
   - Functions passed to memoized children (React.memo)
   - Preventing unnecessary re-renders in component trees
   - Stable function references in dependency arrays

❌ Don't use useCallback for:
   - Simple inline handlers
   - Functions not passed as props
   - Over-optimization without performance issues

✅ Best Practices Applied:
   - Combined with React.memo for maximum benefit
   - Empty deps array for truly stable functions
   - Performance testing setup for validation
   - Clear comments and documentation

=================================================================
🚀 PERFORMANCE IMPACT:

Before: Search re-renders on every parent state change
After:  Search only renders when search functionality is used
Result: Improved performance, especially with complex child components

This demonstrates the real-world value of useCallback in React applications!
